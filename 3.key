A.	Forked the repo above to my Github account, then from my Mac terminal I ran:
% git clone https://github.com/rstatsinger/robot-shop.git

B.	% cd robot-shop; % ls -AF produced a listing with 18 folders (.git/, .github/, DCOS/, K8s/, OpenShift/, Swarm/, cart/, catalogue/, dispatch/, fluentd/, load-gen/, mongo/, mysql/, payment/, ratings/, shipping/, user/, web/). Confirmed using: % ls -AF | grep “/” | wc
